## 1 year at Massive Interactive

*   Good at beginning.
*   Worked as front-end engineer(JS), cordova plugin development (iphone-ObjC and android-java)
*   If you raise your voice against something, you can be issued a warning without listening your plea.
*   People talk in Czech, arrange lunch together, I understand but they do not invite me. (Maybe just Xenophobia)
*   Same work, same mistake, I am yelled, but that guy receives compassion.
*   Also that guy can go to his home without notifying, but I cannot.
*   A guy interrupts me in the meeting, says exact same idea I said five minutes ago.
*   I quit the job, 8 months ago and Still can't find a job.

## Docler holdings in Amsterdam

*   Two months ago
*   I worked there for two weeks
*   After two weeks they violated to contract and forced me to work for 15€
*   Because they had to apply for a work permit
*   I threatened suing them to take my money, and all money gone to hotel
*   You are more vulnerable to exploitation attempts.

## That other company I was interviewed in Amsterdam

*   Very hard to find female developers
*   I ask them if they have a diversity policy?
*   Your gender is not important for us, it's important if you are a good engineer.
*   All male team.
*   At the end they are looking for someone with "broader knowlede." (They too.)

## Book a tiger (Berlin)

*   2 day invitation
*   All male team
*   They check female candidates profile pictures from facebook and comment "nice ass"
*   I ask them if they evaluate female candidates based on their looks.
*   The answer is "Of course we do."
*   At the end they are looking for someone with "broader knowlede." (Note it.)

## Microsoft

*   Job interview in Prague
*   Whiteboard coding question
*   My answer is correct.
*   I wrote a book, have ZCPE, RFC Accepted experience with Java and ObjC
*   They say we appreciate your PHP knowledge but,
*   At the end they are looking for someone with "broader knowlede." (They too.)

## Gender differences is apparent

*   A trans male says that he has not take approval anymore.
*   "He was more carefully listened to and his authority less frequently questioned. He stopped being interrupted in meetings."
*   If you continue to act as a normal person, you can be seen as a "bitch."

## At the end

*   Workplace experiences are bearable
*   Finding a job is almost impossible.
*   People are still afraid of diversity.

## Thanks!
